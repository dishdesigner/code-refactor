    <h1 id="text-analysis-accessibility-report">Text Analysis Accessibility Report</h1>
    <p>This report explains the existing website&#39;s text content in terms of readability.<br>
        Many times, accessibility evaluation only addresses technological access to content.<br>
        But the content itself is always the first place to start!</p>
    <p>If content is written in wordy, dry, technical language full of jargon,<br>
        it doesn&#39;t matter how technologically accessible it is.<br>
        Cognitive accessibility must come first.</p>
    <p>Below is the result of analyzing this website text through the engine at www.readable.com.<br>
        It is free to use and gives a quick overview of the content&#39;s cognitive accessibility for general
        audiences.<br>
        Pro features (paid) allow you to do more with the analysis and format it for various further uses.</p>
